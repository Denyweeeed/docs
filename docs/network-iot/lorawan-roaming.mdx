The Helium Network is the world's largest LoRaWAN Network - and continues to grow at a staggering
pace. Because of this, it becomes a very attractive Network to other public and private LoRaWAN
Network Server providers (LNSs) who want to extend their coverage without deploying their own
infrastructure and capital.

And thanks to the Helium blockchain, direct roaming integrations are very simple. Most importantly,
major LNSs are roaming with the Helium Network, which means the public coverage the Helium Community
is building is now being used by LoRaWAN devices onboarded to other Networks, and Hotspot Operators
get compensated in $HNT for routing these packets.

## Helium Roaming Architecture

Helium Network roaming most closely resembles the LoRa Alliance's idea of "Passive Roaming". The
Helium Community operates a dedicated Roaming Server (the "Helium Roaming Server") that is distinct
from our core LNS for native Helium Devices. The Helium Roaming Server purchases all packets for a
target LoRaWAN `NetID` and forwards them to an endpoint ready to accept them on behalf of a Roaming
Partner's LNS. Specifically, the Helium Roaming Server connects any Helium Gateway that captures
target `NetID` packets via the Semtech GWMP UDP client.

## Actual Roaming Integration

To ingest packets as a roaming partner, you need to accept Semtech GWMP client connections for the
amount of Helium Hotspots that are receiving and routing your packets. Currently, this could be a
lot - assuming you are considering the entire global network. In practice, only a small percentage
of Helium Gateways will be routing packets for a roaming partner NetID simultaneously.

When the roaming PoC is initiated, Helium provides one or more IPs from where the connections will
originate. You will need to supply the IP and port for the host listening for Semtech GWMP
connections over UDP. Once provided, packets will start arriving at the specified host.

## Supported Device Functionality

Helium Roaming supports the following actions for devices:

- **Joining**: a new device provisioned to a roaming partner's LNS can join via the Helium Network.
  For new devices, `join_requests` and `join_accepts` are routed via Helium Hotspots.
- **Uplinking**: Once a device has joined, all device payloads are routed via Helium.
- **Downlinking**: All standard device downlinking is supported.

Helium Roaming Services enables public and private LoRaWAN Network providers around the world to
leverage Helium’s ubiquitous coverage.

With over 993K Hotspots in 190 countries and growing, the Network sees a massive amount of
non-Helium packets. When Network providers enter a roaming partnership with Helium, this traffic can
be forwarded via the Helium Network to partners, increasing their level of service and coverage.

Any compatible device can send data to their Home Network through Helium-compatible Hotspots without
the need for device configurations or firmware updates.

## Getting Started

- **Create an Account** - Contact a Helium Network Advisor to create the initial Helium Roaming
  Services account (sales@nova-labs.com). Initial setup requires an Organization name, and an email
  address for the administrator. As part of the initial account creation process, Net ID ownership
  must be verified for the roaming partner.
- **Add Users** - An administrator can add other user accounts with various roles as needed.
- **Purchase Data Credits** - Data Credits (DCs) are needed to pay for packets sent on the Helium
  Network and can be purchased with a credit card or burning HNT.
- **Configure Network Integration** - Specify the Home network Server address and port, input
  roaming device join credentials, and define how many packets to purchase for devices.
- **Set up Alerts** - Set up email alerts to send to different user roles based on a number of
  conditions including Data Credit balance, user management, or payment methods.

## Users & Organizations

Administrators can add invite users to Organizations via email. Users can be given different access
levels using roles (administrators, managers, and read-only users).

### Adding Users

User roles include:

- `Administrators` can perform all actions
- `Managers` have the same permissions as administrators, but cannot add organizations, manage
  users, or Data Credits
- `Read-only` users cannot take any actions

**To add a new user**

- On Console navigate to the **Users** page, and click **+ Add User**. A pop-up appears.
- Type the email of the new user, and select their desired access level.
- Hit **Submit**. An email invitation is sent that allows a user to join the organization.

### Managing Organizations

Organizations allow users to manage multiple roaming servers using the same account. An Organization
is a virtual container with its own users, Data Credit balance, and configurations.

**Note:** Data Credits can be transferred among Organizations, see Purchasing Data Credits.

**To add a new Organization**

- On Console navigate to the **Organizations** page, and click **+ Add Organizations**. A pop-up
  appears.
- Type the unique name of the Organization.
- Hit **Submit**, the Organization appears.

## Data Credits

Data Credits (DCs) are needed to pay for packets sent on the Helium Network. Every 24 bytes sent in
a packet costs 1 DC which equals $0.00001.

### Purchasing Data Credits

Obtaining Data Credits is the same as on the Helium Console focused on device management and
onboarding. Users can use a credit card (recommended method) and set up a recurring payment or burn
HNT. For a video tutorial of how to purchase Data Credits on Console, check out our Tips & Tricks
video [here](https://youtu.be/jyMGLymuOCE).

In addition to purchasing Data Credits, users can transfer Data Credits among Organizations under
the same account.

To transfer Data Credits (same account only with multiple Organizations): click **Data Credits**,
and hit **Transfer DC to Org**. On the pop up, enter the quantity of Data Credits to transfer and
receiving Organization. Click **Make Transfer**.

## Configurations

There are a number of configurations required to successfully roam on Helium including:

- Configuring the Home Network Server address and port number
- Adding roaming device join credentials
- Specifying how many packets to purchase for devices

### Configuring Integrations

To configure the Helium Roaming Service with a LoRaWAN Network Server a user needs to provide the
address of the Home Network Server and the port number.

On Console, click Configuration and enter the Address (for example yournetworkserver.com) and port
number (for example `1700`) of the Home Network Server

### Adding Device Credentials

Any device that roams on the Helium Network needs to be added to the Configuration page.

Join credentials can be added using multiple methods. Click **Configuration**, and to:

- **Add an individual device**: choose **+Add Join Credential** and enter the device DevEUI and APP
  EUI
- **Import devices with a CSV file**: choose **use CSV File**. To structure the CSV file, add
  app_eui, dev_eui in the header row, followed by rows of the corresponding values.
- **Use a wildcard**: Rather than adding each device, DevEUI’s mapped to a single AppEUI can be
  added using an asterisk wildcard `*`. Choose **+Add Join Credential** and enter `*` for the DevEUI
  field along with the specific AppEUI. Each new AppEUI requires a new entry.

### Purchasing Multiple Packets

The Multiple Packets feature provides the ability to pay for additional packets (if available) for
redundancy and location triangulation purposes.

To enable multiple packet purchase, click **Configuration**, and enter the number of desired
packets. Note: additional packets can only be purchased if multiple Hotspots "hear" and send the
same packet. By default, only `1` packet is purchased.

## Alerts

Email alerts can be set up for a number of conditions related to Data Credit balance, user
management, or payment methods. User types (e.g., Administrator or Managers) can be specified to
receive alerts.

### Setting Up Alerts

To set up email alerts: click **Alerts**, choose alert and user role to receive alerts.

Config Service is an Oracle service that stores all routing information on the Helium IoT Network.
Each roaming partner is registered in the Config Service under their Net ID and may define multiple
routes. Each route contains information such as

- **DevEUI+AppEUI pairs** — so we know which join requests to send your way
- **DevAddr ranges** — so we know which uplinks to send your way
- **Server endpoint + port** — so we know where to send packets to

There are two ways of interacting with the Config Service, directly through GRPC APIs or through CLI
(command-line-interface).

Let’s do some setup with the CLI.

1. Run this to pull & build the config service cli:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/helium/helium-config-service-cli.git
   $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   $ source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
   $ cd helium-config-service-cli
   $ cargo b --release
   ```

2. You can then find the built binary file `helium-config-service.cli` under `./target/release`
   inside the `helium-config-service-cli` directory. I’d rename it into short such as `main` so you
   can type less words (you can rename it by running `mv helium-config-service-cli main`)

3. Now that we have the CLI binary, let’s just put it in a separate folder. This is recommended only
   for simplicity's sake. Just copy `main` into the folder you created. You can reference the
   following commands:

   ```bash
   $ cd ..
   $ mkdir cli-testing
   $ cd cli-testing
   $ cp ../helium-config-service-cli/target/release/main .
   ```

4. Let’s generate the keypair you’ll be using to authenticate your interactions with the config
   service, so only you can create/modify/delete routes. Run `./main env generate-keypair --commit`
   and you should find a file called `keypair.bin`. Print out the public key of your keypair by
   running:

   ```bash
   $ ./main env info --keypair keypair.bin
   ```

5. Next, make sure you have a Helium Wallet.
   [You can download them here](https://wallet.helium.com/).

6. Contact the Helium Foundation with your public key and Helium Wallet address via email at
   [hello@helium.foundation](mailto:hello@helium.foundation) for the information needed in the next
   steps.

7. Next, let’s initialize some environment variables so that you don’t have to tell the CLI the same
   thing over and over again in later commands:

   1. Run `./main env init`
   1. Fill in `http://mainnet-config.helium.io:6080/` for `Config Service Host`
   1. Fill in the path `./keypair.bin` for `Keypair Location`
   1. Fill in your NET ID for `Net ID`
   1. Fill in your OUI for `Assigned OUI`
   1. Fill in the number of multi-buy you want for `Default Max Copies` as a default for your
      routes.
   1. Then export the environment variables. This needs to be done manually. You will see something
      like this and just add `export` to each line and run it. For instance, you would run export
      `HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15` variable. Do NOT put a space around the `=` sign

   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/open-lns/roaming-setup-env-variables.svg')} />

8. Now, you are ready to generate your first route. Routes contain necessary information for us to
   know how to route a packet — DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr range (for
   routing uplinks), Endpoint (so we know where to send the packet to), etc.

   1. Run `./main route new --commit`
   1. You can then see the empty route template. It should look like this, except that you should be
      seeing your own Net ID, assigned OUI, max_copies in there:

   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/open-lns/roaming-setup-generate-route.svg')} />

9. Next, let’s define DevAddr range so packet router knows which uplinks to route to your endpoint.
   Just use your OUI’s assigned DevAddr range, which you can get by running `./main org get`.
   Afterwards, run:

   ```bash
   $ ./main route devaddrs add -s <start> -e <end> --route-id <route-id> -- commit
   ```

10. Next, let’s define EUI pairs so packet router knows which join requests to route to your
    endpoint. You can run:

    ```bash
    $ ./main route euis add --route-id <route-id> -d <dev-eui> -a <app-eui> --commit
    ```

11. Next, let’s define the endpoint that you use for ingesting traffic. You can run:

    ```bash
    $ ./main route update server --host <host> --port <port> --route-id <route-id> --commit
    ```

12. Lastly, define other relevant parameters for HTTP roaming. You can run:
    ```bash
    $ ./main route update http --dedupe-timeout <dedupe-timeout> --path <url path> --auth-header <auth-header> --route-id <route-id> --commit
    ```
